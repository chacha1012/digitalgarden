Napier杂岩
UHT began at ca. 2580Ma无争议，但结束时间争议较大
Clark 2018 JMG：reset zircon cores 2502-2439Ma；zircon rims of 2491-2454Ma；neocrystallized sector-zoned zircon from 2492-2443Ma（用锆石-石榴石分配系数平衡表征锆石是UHT期间形成的）——UHT从2585-2450，持续了135Ma
UHT形成机制：造山高原的形成+2850Ma的高温岩浆和UHT变质事件对地壳的预处理+部分熔融过程中产热元素的无效去除+缓慢折返速率；可能与超大陆的聚合有关
主要岩石组成：2990-2800Ma的英云闪长至花岗质正片麻岩，夹层层状变质沉积岩和少量基性/超基性单元
三期变形事件：D1（线性S1组构——导致岩性置换和交错）
D2（S1的refolded，around tight F2 folds，S2片麻理不普遍）
D3（导致区域上dome-and-basin的形成）一套角闪岩相剪切带和假玄武玻璃是最终变形阶段
D1, D2是UHT
变质演化：UHT近等压冷却IBC，南部~9-10kbar，北部<8kbar
	shimizu（2013）Tonagh island西部近IBC，Priestly peak东部峰后减压，12kbar
	经历了不同的构造历史，subduction/collisional system
	Hokada（2018）：UHT带从北到南4kbar压力变化是沿剪切带垂直运动将不同地壳并置的结果
变质机制：增厚造山带再伸展减薄（岩石圈减薄或detachment）
逆时针挤压进变质，预先抽取了一波，更容易达到UHT，原岩多数已经经历了早期高温变质2840Ma
缓慢的IBC到650℃，在2350Ma，Sm-Nd，Lu-Hf等时线
LHO：碰撞，埋藏自生热

## 1984 McCulloch and Black
Sm-Nd of Enderby Land granulites
Napier complex at Fyfe Hills, charnockites, leuconorites and gabbros yield a whole rock Sm-Nd isochron age of 3060±160 Ma
~3100 Ma dated by Rb-Sr and U-Pb zircon studies ==initial granulite facies==
~2450 Ma redistribution of Sm and Nd and re-equilibration of Nd143/Nd144 occurred on an intermineral scale during the upper amphibolite to lower granulite facies metamorphism==subsequent upper amphibolite to granulite facies==
207pb-206pb and U-Pb ages of about 4000 m.y. have been reported for charnockitic gneisses at Fyfe Hills
earliest continental crust in this area formed about 3800 m.y. ago
## 1968 Dallwitz Nature
Enderby Land, Antarctica
sa+qtz in granulite from a small nunatak (66°57′S，51°31′E)
belongs to a gneiss-granulite-charnockite terrain
consist of rutilated quartz, cordierite-quartz inergrowths, sapphirine as grains up to 2 mm long, accessory sillimanite, garnet, hypersthene, rutile, chlorite, zircon and biotite.
hypersthene invariably contains fine rutile needles and may be partly or wholly altered to chlorite.
in high pressure experiments on complex model pelitic compositions, a P-T field around 9 kbar and 1100℃ in which sapphirine and quartz co-exist.

two separated orogenic episodes within the time interval 600-500 Ma

tectonothermal events: 
- mid-archean 3400-3000
- late archean to earliest proterozoic 2900-2450
- paleoproterozoic 2200-1700
- meso- to neoproterozoic 1400-910
- latest proterozoic to cambrian 600-500

==Mawson block== of Terre Adelie and other areas on the eastern fringe of EAS: archean to paleoproterozoic geological record 
Terre Adelie basement: c. 3050-3150 Ma gneisses and c. 2560-2450 Ma supracrustals metamorphosed in c.2440 Ma, and rift-related sediments and volcanics deposited between c.1775 and 1700 Ma and metamorphosed at 1710-1690 Ma in the Kimban tectonothermal event (low-pressure granulite in here and eclogite facies in Nimrod group)
==Denman Glacier/Obruchev Hills area:== granitic and tonalitic orthogneiss precursors (c.3000-2640 Ma), the older orthogneiss affected by a granulite facies metamorphic event at ==c.2890Ma==
==Vestfold Block== 2520-2480 Ma: main magmatic accretion events and crust formation
2520 Ma tonalitic orthogneisses and pyroxene granulites and supracrustal rocks including metavolcanics, Fe-rich semipelitic sediments, and MgeAl rich claystones were metamorphosed under granulite conditions by 2500 Ma
syntectonic Crooked Lake Gneisses were then emplaced and overprinted in an upper amphibolite
to granulite deformation episode from c.2500 to 2480 Ma or over a longer time interval to c.2450 Ma
A pre-2530 Ma geological record is preserved in the Grace Lake Granodiorite, a migmatitic granodioritic orthogneiss that contains inherited zircons up to c.2800 Ma age and records a TDM(Nd) model age of c.3050 Ma
maximum depositional ages of c.2575 Ma for their sedimentary precursors
==Lambert Province or terrane== felsic to intermediate orthogneisses derived from granitoids emplaced at c.2490-2420 Ma
tectonothermal events at 2420 and 2180-2080, and possible 1800,1600
orthogneiss derived from granitoids: elevated εNd values (to +6.4) and TDM approximating 2400 Ma——juvenile crustal additions at c.2450 Ma
others: highly negative εNd values at 2400 Ma (to -6.4) and thus have old TDM model ages (3200-3800 Ma) that imply the involvement of older Archean crust in their genesis, some of which might be represented by a c.3500 Ma orthogneiss from the Manning Glacier area
reworked by Rayner Orogeny at 940-905; late Neoproterozoic-cambrian Prydz event at 530-490

==Grundehogna craton==: 3067±8 granitic basement, overlain by c. 1100-1000 shelf sediments and volcanics
similar with kaapvaal craton Inherited zircons in the granite preserve ages up to 3433 ± 7 Ma
Zircon Hf model ages: early Archean crustal sources with model ages of 3500 Ma, 3750 Ma, and possibly 3900 Ma may have contributed to the magma that eventually crystallized the Annandagstoppane granite. 早期地壳源是此处花岗岩结晶的来源
==Ruker terrane== : polyphase Archean (c.3390e3155 Ma) granite gneiss basement, the Mawson Orthogneiss Suite, crustal components at least as old as c.3390 Ma, and on the basis of Sm-Nd model ages (TDM) of c.3200-3900 Ma
==Kemp Land==: adjacent Napier Complex, has been regarded as the reworked equivalent of NC
==Napier Complex==: contains the oldest rocks yet recorded from Antarctica, up to c.3850
granulite facies metamorphism ,c.3270, 3130, 3070-2970 and 2840-2800, high-T and low-P metamorphic event at 2840-2820
1000 and 1120°C at depths of 20-35 km
the age of the UHT metamorphism in the Napier Complex is now constrained to be younger
than 2626±28 Ma, which is the protolith age of a granodioritic orthogneiss from Tonagh Island
final melt crystallization and fluid expulsion that occurred as the Complex cooled, at depth in the crust, through 700-750°C
- ==Fyfe Hills== metamorphic events at c.2840 and 2580-2480, deposited prior to at least c.3100 Ma
- ==Aker Peaks== Archean zircon ages for charnockitic and tonalitic orthogneisses, with the main populations at 3630-3580 and 3550-3450 Ma. Belyatsky et al. (2011) interpret these results in terms of an early Archean granulite, even UHT event at 3630 Ma accompanied by contemporaneous felsic-intermediate magmatism.

## Chris 2018
UHTM in Napier complex was followed by a period of IBC at pressure of <8kbar in the northern parts of the complex and at pressure of ~9-10kbar in areas farther south
Hollis and Harley 2002 reported evidence for 1-3kbar of ITD at >1000, then IBC
Shimizu, Tsunogae, and Santosh (2013): Tonagh island in the west have near IBC paths, to the east at Priestly peak up to 5 kbar of post peak decompression from 12 kbar, interpreted as different positions within a subduction/collisional system.
Hokada 2008: the observed 4 kbar of pressure variation from north to south across the UHT zone is a result of juxtaposition of different crustal blocks by vertical movement along shear zones.
2850 was a low-P, high-T metamorphic/magmatic event prior to the 2500 UHT event

 Cordierite= Sapphirine+Quartz
 which would proceed to the right-hand side under the higher-pressure condition.
 Mg-cordierite would break into sapphirine+quartz at least at 7-8 kbars under a unhydrous condition.
 Sapphirine+ Quartz = Orthopyroxene + Sillimanite
 Cordierite = Garnet + Sillimanite + Quartz
 why the Napier Complex alone has remained unaffected by the post-stage metamorphism since 2.5 Ga ago?
### Motoyoshi 1989

### Owada 1999
mafic and ultramafic rocks
These geochemical features imply that original rock of some mafic gneiss and metamorphosed ultramafic rocks from Tonagh Island were Archaean komatiitic rock.
### Owada 2000
the LREE-ennched and flat types of the mafic gneisses and the meta-ultramafic rocks on Tonagh Island would have been derived from different source mantles with respect to LREE signatures
